## Homology Modeling Pipeline

This homology modeling pipeline is designed to streamline and automate the task of creating 3-D models in a .pdb format for a given UniProtKB accession code. Other than remotely accessing UniProtKB in order to access the amino acid sequence and retrieving the template .pdb structure from the Protein Data Bank, the modeling process will take place entirely on your local machine.
